# abstract.sh
Changes desktop background to my latest abstract upload.
Checks every hour for a new Abstract from https://vlepy.github.io and sets it as a desktop wallpaper.

Config section resides in the first block of the abstract.sh script and in the first section of the install.sh file.

In case you ran the application from terminal and it says "I'ts already running" check the process list for it, if it's not there remove /tmp/abstract

Have fun.
