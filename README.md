# abstract.sh
Changes desktop background to my latest abstract upload.
Checks every hour for a new Abstract from https://vlepy.github.io and sets it as a desktop wallpaper.

Config section resides in the first block of the abstract.sh script and in the first section of the install.sh file.

Have fun.
